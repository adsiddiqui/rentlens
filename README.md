# rentlens

*I created RentLens because I struggled to find reliable rent prices in different neighborhoods. RentLens is a user-friendly tool that shows rent per square foot for various listings on an interactive map.

You can easily filter results in real-time, view heat maps to see price trends, adjust range sliders to fit your budget, and save your favorite listings for easy comparisons.

Currently available for the San Francisco Bay Area, with more cities coming soon. It made house hunting much simpler and transparent for me, and I hope it helps others too!
